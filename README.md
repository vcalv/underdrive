**[INSTALL LATEST VERSION](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/vcalv/underdrive/master/web-ext-artifacts/559d8e3e0e284bddbbfa-1.2.xpi)**

# Description

Firefox extension for Overdrive.

**Only Firefox supported**

# Usage

Allows you to use [Overdrive](https://overdrive.com) as if mp3/odm download was still available.

Just go to https://yourlibraryid.overdrive.com/account/loans and next to each audiobook you'll find a button that allows you to download the `.odm` file.

Use whatever tool you used to use to download the `mp3` file from the odm.

I use my fork of [overdrive.sh](https://github.com/vcalv/overdrive.sh).

# Credits

Shamelessly adapted from https://gist.github.com/ping/b58ae66359691db1d08f929a9e57a03d to use pure DOM functions.

Also removes some stupid libby elements.
